## Health-Checks

for applications working on production environment, its necessary to know the current status of them. 
- are they up and running?
- are their dependencies are up and running also?
- if they go offline, who is gonna notice first? we ? or the clients?

health check helps you to overcome this problem. 
by adding a health check to your project you can always know the status of your project by checking a webpage easily.
and also notify if something happend with its webhocks before anyone else.
